# Contributing
### Committing Procedures
1. Before committing any changes, make sure that the code can build.

2. If the code fails due to spotless formating, be sure to run `` ./gradlew spotlessApply`` in order to format the code. Then after formating the code, try building the code once more.

3. Once your code can build, go ahead and commit it to a new branch (if you are in branch "main", you must create a new branch with ``git checkout -b *branch name*``), or the branch you were working in, then push.

### End of Shop Procedures
Ensure all your code is pushed to github before you leave!
